Teamet vil til en start bestå af 8 kyndige kollegaer, som, udover førnævnte kundefokus, også i dagtimerne vil agere super-kollegaer og supportere resten af vores organisation i henhold til eskaleringer, vidensdeling, drift af systemer med videre. Nu tænker du måske...Fellowmind som arbejdspladsHvem er Fellowmind, og hvorfor er vi et godt match? Fellowmind er en softwareorienteret konsulentvirksomhed, der først og fremmest stræber efter at skabe meningsfulde forbindelser værdifulde for alle involverede parter. Vi er passionerede nørder (eller specialister, om man vil), som hjælper vores kunder med at accelerere deres digitale platform via Microsofts brede vifte af løsninger. Som ny kollega i Fellowmind vil du møde en organisation, der ikke kun tillader men tilskynder personlig og faglig udvikling, hvorfor selve arbejdsmiljøet også i høj grad bærer præg af tillid, nysgerrighed og respekt alle kollegaer imellem. Sagt med andre ord er Fellowmind sandsynligvis ikke stedet for dig, hvis du ønsker en arbejdsplads, hvor din stilling er statisk, udviklingsmulighederne er små og stemningen er trykket. Primære arbejdsopgaverHovedopgaven for ITOC-teamet bliver at sikre respons 24/7/365 for de af vores kunder, som har valgt denne service, og dette dækker både over drift, overvågning og telefoniske henvendelser. Det er et team under opbygning, så du vil i høj grad få mulighed for bidrage til at skabe kulturen og præge dynamikken, så I får et stærkt samarbejde. Som en del af teamet bliver man også ansvarlig for at varetage ”core drift” af services hos vores kunder, hvilket relaterer sig til afvikling af standard driftsopgaver samt så vidt muligt automatisering heraf. Det er derfor ideelt, hvis du besidder en god blanding af tekniske kompetencer og kommunikative evner, så du både kan hjælpe kunderne og forklare dem, hvorfor du lige har reddet deres dag.Som ITOC Specialist vil du have din daglige gang i vores Operation Center, og jobbet vil byde på skiftende arbejdstider med blandt andet natte- og weekendarbejde, så vores kunder altid har en livline i tilfælde af IT-kriser. Vi kan skrive en mindre e-bog om de nøjagtige ting, som vores ITOC Specialister får lov at prøve kræfter med, men for overblikkets skyld lader vi det være ved ovenstående for nu – og så er vi altid tilgængelige til en uddybende snak herom.Din profilSkal vi beskrive netop dig som person med tre ord, vil valget formegentlig falde på følgende adjektiver: flink, selvstændig og fleksibel. Du vil opleve en stor grad af frihed under ansvar, hvorfor du trives i at tage kvalificerede beslutninger og tænke på fødderne, så tingene kan gå op i en højere enhed. Hvad angår dit faglige udgangspunkt, hører vi fuglene synge, hvis du kommer med en relevant teknisk uddannelse såsom eksempelvis IT-supporter eller data-tekniker - eller hvis du har lignende erfaring. Du kommer derudover med en erfaring indenfor Microsoft-universet, og du kan godkendes på højeste sikkerhedsniveau som den superhelt, du er.  Er du nået hertil, er der kun tilbage at sige, at vi venter spændt på at høre fra dig, og vi glæder os til at læse din ansøgning! Har du spørgsmål til stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte Manager Tommy på +45 93101981.
