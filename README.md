### Project Title: Skillset Clustering in Job Markets

#### Objective:

To scrape job postings from LinkedIn, cluster them into distinct categories based on the job descriptions, and identify the top 5 skills required for each cluster. This can help job seekers understand the current market trends and prepare accordingly.

#### Tools and Techniques:

- **Web Scraping**: Scrape the job posting data from **LinkedIn**
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data (tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words)
- **Feature Extraction**: Use Tf.idf measure to convert the text data into numerical format.
- **Clustering**: Apply clustering algorithms like K-means or DBSCAN to group similar job postings together.
- **Skill Extraction**: Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) or keyword extraction to identify the skills mentioned in each cluster.
- **Visualization**: Use visualization tools to represent the clusters and the top skills.

#### Steps:

1. **Data Collection**:

   - Use web scraping tools to extract job postings (title, description, location, etc.) from LinkedIn.
   - Store the collected data in a structured format for analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Clean the text data by removing special characters, numbers, and stop words.
   - Apply stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.

3. **Feature Extraction**:

   - Apply the **Tf.idf** measure to convert text data into numerical format, capturing the importance of different terms.

4. **Clustering**:

   - Use **K-means, DBSCAN**, or other clustering algorithms to group similar job postings.
   - Optimize the number of clusters using techniques like the Elbow Method
   - Calculate the quality of the cluster using **Davies-Bouldin index**

5. **Skill Extraction**:

   - Apply NER or keyword extraction to identify the skills in each cluster.
   - Rank the skills based on their frequency or importance.

6. **Visualization**:

   - Visualize the clusters and the top 5 skills for each cluster using bar graphs, word clouds, or other visualization methods.

7. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the quality of clusters and the relevance of extracted skills.
   - Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

#### Report Outline:

- **Introduction**: Introduce the problem and its relevance in the current job market.
- **Methodology**: Explain the tools and techniques used, including web scraping, text preprocessing, clustering, and skill extraction.
- **Results**: Present the clusters and the top 5 skills for each cluster, along with visualizations.
- **Evaluation**: Discuss the quality of clusters, the relevance of skills extracted, and the insights gained from the analysis.
- **Conclusion**: Conclude with the projectâ€™s findings, potential applications, and suggestions for future work.

#### Extra:

Integrate machine learning models to predict the popularity or demand for certain skills in the future, based on historical and current data trends. Utilize time-series forecasting models or trends analysis to achieve this.
